These are all of the things, stacked!

Pretty much every resource supported by [Stackery]() at the moment.

## Deployment

Please don't, this will break all the things. This is for layout and documentation purposes only.

## Resources

### A table

Let's display a markdown table for fun:

| foo | bar | and | so | on |
|-----|-----|-----|----|----|
| 1   | 2   | 3   | 4  | 5  |
| 6   | 7   | 8   | 9  | 10 |
| 11  | 12  | 13  | 14 | 15 |

### A codeblock

Here's what a codeblock looks like, yay!

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  // Log the event argument for debugging and for use in local development.
  console.log(JSON.stringify(event, undefined, 2));

  return {};
};
```
